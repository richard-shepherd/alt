ALT - Another Log Tailer
------------------------
- A log tailer designed to be run in a client-server way

- The server can be hosted on a remote machine and communicate
  with the client via a network transport

- The server should also be able to be run locally, ie in the same process
  if we want to create a standalone tail app

- The UI should be separate from the client library
  - So that the client-server code can be used with differnt UIs
  - We should prvide a default / sample UI

- Features
  - The client should cache a configured amount of data
  - Configurable text highlighting in the UI, eg for ERROR, WARN etc
  - Text search which is performed server side
  - Find lines by timestamp
  - Updates from the server can be compressed when being sent via the transport


Components
----------
  UI - Client - (Transport) - Server


Transport and interfaces
------------------------
- The server exposes an IServer interface
  - The client plugs in to an IServer
  - This could be the Server directly
  - Or it could be to the Transport which exposes the IServer interface to the client
    - And then connects to the real Server by its IServer interface

- The client exposes an IClient interface (to the UI)


Finding lines by timestamp
